The classes in the S4 library comprise some core, original functionality as well as wrapper (utility) classes that ease the development of iPhone applications.  I have attempted to make the wrapper classes expose as much of the underlying functionality as possible, without getting so 'thin' that they do not provide a useful abstraction in and of themselves.  The more complex "original core" classes balance abstraction with granularity.  In any event, you have the source code so they can be used and modified at will (under the terms of the Mozilla Public License 1.1).  Feedback, reviews, and suggestions are gladly accepted.  Contact me if you would like to contribute to this effort.
